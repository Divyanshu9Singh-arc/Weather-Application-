🌦️ Weather Application

This Weather Application is a user-friendly web application designed to provide real-time weather information for any location around the world. The application fetches live data from a reliable public weather API and displays accurate weather details in a clean and responsive interface.

Users can search for a city to view current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall weather status (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.). The application ensures fast data retrieval and smooth user interaction, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

The project focuses on demonstrating API integration, asynchronous data handling, and dynamic UI updates using modern web technologies. Error handling is implemented to manage invalid city names or network issues, ensuring a better user experience.

This project is ideal for beginners and intermediate developers who want to learn how to work with external APIs, handle real-time data, and build responsive web applications. It can also serve as a foundation for advanced features like weather forecasts, geolocation support, or theme customization.
